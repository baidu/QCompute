        The rule to swap two commands are illustrated in the reference [arXiv:0704.1263].
        Please see the reference [arXiv:0704.1263] for more details.

        Note:
            This is an intrinsic method. No need to call it externally.

        Hint:
            The commands in the list are executed from the left to the right as default.
            For example, the command 'E' represents the entanglement command.
            According to the MBQC procedure, entanglements are executed in the first step.
            Therefore the command 'E' should be in the left side of the list.
            After the entanglements, the measurement commands are executed, and so on.
