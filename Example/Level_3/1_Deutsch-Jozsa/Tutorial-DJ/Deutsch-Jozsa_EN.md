# Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm

Deutsch-Jozsa is an alogrithm to display advantage of quantum computation over classical computation.

Suppose there is a function $f$, defined on all n-bit binary strings, taking value 0 or 1, and it is either constant  or balanced (i.e. half of the results are 1 and the other half 0). Now the task is to check whether it is a constant function. Although the result can be determined immediately when two different values occur, it's still tough to determine whether it is indeed a constant function, for all $2^{n-1}+1$ values must be examined without any one ignored. Exponential-grown resource is need. But in a quantum computer, given a unitary transformation with information of $f$ (often referred as a quantum oracle), $U_f$, only one examination is needed to get the result.

The quantum circuit of this algorithm is:

where the initial state $|x\rangle=|0^{\otimes n}\rangle$, $|y\rangle=|1\rangle$. $U_f$ is defined as: 
$$
\begin{aligned}
U_f:\{0,1\}^n\times\{0,1\}\rightarrow\{0,1\}^n\times\{0,1\}\\
|x\rangle \otimes|y\rangle\rightarrow|x\rangle \otimes|y\oplus f(x)\rangle\\
\end{aligned}
$$
$U_f$ will act on the prepared state:
$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{n+1}}}\sum_{x=0}^{2^n-1}|x\rangle(|0\rangle-|1\rangle)
$$
Then measure the front n qubits, we get:
$$
\begin{aligned}
&\bigg ( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{n}}}\sum_{x=0}^{2^n-1}\langle x|\otimes I\bigg )\bigg(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{n+1}}}\sum_{x=0}^{2^n-1}|x\rangle\big(|f(x)\rangle-|1\oplus f(x)\rangle\big)\bigg)\\
&=\bigg ( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{n}}}\sum_{x=0}^{2^n-1}\langle x|\otimes I\bigg )\bigg(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2^{n+1}}}\sum_{x=0}^{2^n-1}(-1)^{f(x)}|x\rangle\big(|0\rangle-|1\rangle\big)\bigg)\\
&=\frac{1}{2^n}\sum_{x=0}^{2^n-1}(-1)^{f(x)}|-\rangle
\end{aligned}
$$
And the measurement result shall be 1 or 0 if $f$ is constant or not.

If $f$ is constant the probability is$|\frac{1}{2^n}\times 2^n|^2=1$, else it is $|\frac{1}{2^n}\times\big( (-1)\times2^{n-1}+1\times2^{n-1}\big)|^2=0$.


Now let's try it out on Quantum Leaf. Examine two examples: $f_1=0$, $f_2(x)$ = the first qubit of $x$. ​

The result is like: (The highest position is $|y\rangle = |-\rangle$, and it may be 0 or 1)
```python
Result {'0000000000': 1}
Outcome |0>^n|y> appears, so the function is constant.
Result {'0000000001': 1}
Outcome other than |0>^n|y> appears, so the function is balanced.
