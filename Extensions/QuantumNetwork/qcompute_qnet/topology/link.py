class Link(Entity):
    r"""Class for creating a link.

    Attributes:
        ends (Tuple[Node]): ends connected by the link

    Note:
        ``Link`` is an abstract concept indicating the connectivity between two nodes.
        The information transmission is realized by its channel components.
        So we should install classical and quantum channels to a link before running the simulation.

    Examples:
        We can create a link between two nodes (e.g. alice and bob) by two approaches.
        The first approach is to instantiate a ``Link`` with given ``name``.
        Then using the ``connect`` method to make a connection to alice and bob.

        >>> l_ab = Link(name="Link_Alice_Bob")
        >>> l_ab.connect(alice, bob)

        The second approach is to assign the two ends when instantiating.
        This will make your code more compact.

        >>> l_ab = Link(name="Link_Alice_Bob", ends=(alice, bob))

        Once we create a link, we can install some specific channels to it. Taking BB84 protocol as an example,
        we need a classical channel from alice to bob and a classical channel from bob to alice.
        We will also need a quantum channel from alice to bob. This can be done as follows:

        >>> l_ab = Link(name="Link_Alice_Bob", ends=(alice, bob))
        >>> c_a2b = ClassicalFiberChannel(name="c_a2b", distance=1e3, sender=alice, receiver=bob)
        >>> c_b2a = ClassicalFiberChannel(name="c_b2a", distance=1e3, sender=bob, receiver=alice)
        >>> q_a2b = QuantumFiberChannel(name="q_a2b", distance=1e3, sender=alice, receiver=bob)
        >>> l_ab.install([c_a2b, c_b2a, q_a2b])
