    Note that ``Photon`` is a specific type of ``QuantumMessage``.

    Attributes:
        wavelength (float): wavelength of the photon in nanometers
        state (MixedState): quantum state of the photon
        index (int): index of the photon in a pulse sequence

        The ``index`` is actually obtained from a time synchronization module, but we regard it as an attribute of
