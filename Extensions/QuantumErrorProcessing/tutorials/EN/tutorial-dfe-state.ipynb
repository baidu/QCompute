    "Quantum State Tomography gives complete information about the state we prepared, but it is very resource-consuming, and sometimes we only care about the fidelity between the ideal and actual quantum states. Direct Fidelity Estimation (DFE) is a simple method for certifying that how close between the actually prepared state and the ideal state.\n",
