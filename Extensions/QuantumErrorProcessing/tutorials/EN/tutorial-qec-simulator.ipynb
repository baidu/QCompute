The main idea behind quantum error correction is to encode the quantum information in a way that errors can be detected and corrected without destroying the quantum state. This concept is crucial for the development of practical quantum computers, which require error correction to maintain the integrity of their quantum computations.\n",

    "### Brief introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Stabilizer codes are originally introduced by Daniel Gottesman in 1997 and have become an important tool in the theory and practice of quantum error correction. The basic idea behind stabilizer codes is to encode a quantum state in such a way that errors can be detected and corrected. The key to this encoding is a set of operators called *stabilizers*, which are defined as the generators of a group of symmetries that leave the encoded state invariant. Specifically, the stabilizers are a set of commuting Pauli operators, which include the identity $I$, $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, a stabilizer code is defined by a pair of subspaces, the *code subspace* and the *complement subspace*, that are orthogonal complements of each other. The code subspace is spanned by the eigenstates of the stabilizers, which have eigenvalue $+1$. The complement subspace is spanned by the eigenstates of the stabilizers with eigenvalue $-1$. The stabilizers themselves are products of Pauli operators that act non-trivially only on the qubits in the code subspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how stabilizer codes protect quantum information, consider the case where a single qubit experiences an error due to environmental noise. This error can be represented by a Pauli operator that acts non-trivially on the affected qubit. If the code subspace is designed so that the stabilizers commute with this error operator, then the error can be detected by measuring the eigenvalues of the stabilizers. Specifically, if the eigenvalues of all the stabilizers are $+1$, then the error has not occurred. If the eigenvalues of one or more stabilizers are $-1$, then the error has occurred and the qubit must be corrected.\n",
    "\n",
    "A stabilizer code can be mathematically described using three parameters,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\llbracket n, k, d\\rrbracket,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n$ is the number of *physical qubits* forming the code subspace, $k$ is the number of *logical qubits* that can be protected from error, and $d$ is the *minimum distance* of the code. The minimum distance is the smallest number of simultaneous qubit errors that can transform one valid codeword into another or the minimum number of errors required to change one encoded state into another. The distance of the code measures its error-correcting capability, with higher distance values indicating better error correction. It's important to note that every useful stabilizer code must have $n > k$, as physical redundancy is necessary to detect and correct errors without disturbing the logical state. Let $\\mathbb{P}_n$ be the $n$-qubit Pauli group and $\\mathcal{S}\\subseteq\\mathbb{P}_n$ be the set of stabilizer generators corresponding to the stabilizer code $\\llbracket n, k, d\\rrbracket$. By definition, the number of stabilizer generators satisfies $r = \\vert\\mathcal{S}\\vert = n − k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical states\n",
    "\n",
    "An $n$-qubit quantum state $\\vert\\psi\\rangle$ is a valid *logical state* of a stabilizer code $\\llbracket n, k, d\\rrbracket$, also known as the *codeword state*, if and only if for every Pauli operator $P\\in\\mathcal{S}$, where $\\mathcal{S}$ is the stabilizer generators of the code, it holds that $P\\vert\\psi\\rangle=\\vert\\psi\\rangle$. That is, the state $\\vert\\psi\\rangle$ is stabilized by $P$. All valid codeword states form a code subspace of dimension $2^k$, allowing us to encode $k$ logical qubits. Usually, we identify the logical basis states of the code subspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logical state is very important in quantum error correction because it encodes the information that is to be protected against errors. By measuring the stabilizer generators, it is possible to detect and correct errors that have occurred in the encoded qubits without directly measuring the state of the logical qubits themselves. This is important because measuring a quantum state can disturb its state, potentially introducing errors that defeat the purpose of error correction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example.** Consider the simplest example of the three-qubit bit-flip code $\\llbracket 3, 1, 1\\rrbracket$. It encodes $1$ logical qubit to $3$ physical quibts and is completely specified by the stabilizer generators $\\mathcal{S}=\\{IZZ, ZZI\\}$. One can easily verify that $\\vert 000 \\rangle$ and $\\vert 111 \\rangle$ are stabilized by $\\mathcal{S}$ and thus the corresponding code space $\\mathcal{C}$ has dimension $2$. The complement subspace can be classified as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\mathcal{C} &= {\\rm span}\\{\\vert 000 \\rangle, \\vert 111 \\rangle\\}, \\\\\n",
    "\\mathcal{C}_0^\\perp &= {\\rm span}\\{\\vert 001 \\rangle, \\vert 110 \\rangle\\}, \\\\\n",
    "\\mathcal{C}_1^\\perp &= {\\rm span}\\{\\vert 010 \\rangle, \\vert 101 \\rangle\\}, \\\\\n",
    "\\mathcal{C}_2^\\perp &= {\\rm span}\\{\\vert 100 \\rangle, \\vert 011 \\rangle\\}.\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that each single-qubit bit-flip errors $X_0$, $X_1$, and $X_2$ will rotate the code space to a unique complement space, i.e., for arbitrary quantum state $\\vert\\psi\\rangle\\in\\mathcal{C}$, it holds that $X_i\\vert\\psi\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{C}_i^\\perp$. By measuring the two stabilizers $IZZ$ and $ZZI$, which will not change the logical basis states $\\vert 000 \\rangle$ and $\\vert 111 \\rangle$, we are able to detect which qubit has been flipped and then flip the corrupted qubit back to its correct state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General framework\n",
    "\n",
    "![QEC](./figures/qec-framework-en.png \"Figure 1: General Framework of Quantum Error Correction. \")\n",
    "\n",
    "As illustrated in the above figure, the general framework of a stabilizer code involves four key steps: encoding, error detection, error correction, and decoding. Specifically,\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Encoding:** In the encoding step, the quantum information $\\vert\\psi\\rangle$ is encoded onto a logical state in the code space that is protected by the stabilizer code. This is typically done using a set of quantum gates that implement a quantum error-correcting code. The encoded state is a superposition of logical basis states that are protected by the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Error Detection:** In the error detection step, the stabilizers of the code are measured to check if any errors have occurred (known as the stabilizer measurement). The stabilizers are a set of Pauli operators that commute with each other and act non-trivially only on the code subspace. The eigenvalues of the stabilizers are measured to determine if any errors have occurred. If all stabilizers have eigenvalue $+1$, the state is in the code subspace and no errors have occurred. If any stabilizer has eigenvalue $-1$, then an error has occurred. Notice that in this step, we need clean ancilla qubits to implement the stabilizer measurements and record the error syndromes.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Error Correction:** In the error correction step, the error is corrected by applying a set of gates that depend on the error syndrome, which is determined from the measurement of the stabilizers in the previous step. The gates are designed to reverse the effect of the error and return the state to the code subspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ **Decoding:** In the decoding step, the encoded information $\\vert\\psi\\rangle$ is extracted from the protected logical state. This is typically done by measuring a subset of the qubits in the code subspace, which collapses the state to one of the basis states. The measurement outcomes are used to reconstruct the original quantum state that was encoded using the code. In the simplest case, one can simply reverse the encoding procedure in step 1 to achieve decoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the framework we can see that the key to the success of a stabilizer code is the choice of **stabilizers**, which must be carefully chosen to detect and correct errors while preserving the quantum information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, stabilizer codes are a powerful tool for protecting quantum information from decoherence due to environmental noise. They are defined by a set of commuting Pauli operators called stabilizers, which encode quantum states in a way that allows errors to be detected and corrected. Stabilizer codes have become an important tool in the theory and practice of quantum error correction, and have found numerous applications in quantum computing and communication."
