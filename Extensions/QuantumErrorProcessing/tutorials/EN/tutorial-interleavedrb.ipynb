    "## Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assume *a priori* that the readers are familiar with Clifford gates, or you can checkout the SRB module. We treat IRB as a modification to the SRB protocol, where we construct the random circuits using Clifford gates in SRB.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of random circuit in SRB is as followed:\n",
    "\n",
    "![random-clifford-circuit](figures/srb-clifford-circuit.png \"Figure 1: random Clifford circuit of SRB\")\n",
    "\n",
    "For experimental implementation of the random circuit above, we first apply $m$ random Clifford gates, and then we apply the inverse of whole $m$ Clifford gates $C_{m+1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C_{m+1} := \\left(C_1C_2\\cdots C_{m-1}C_{m}\\right)^{-1}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the ideal situation, the output state should be equal to the input state\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C_{m+1}C_{m}C_{m-1}\\cdots C_2C_1\\vert \\phi \\rangle = \\vert \\phi \\rangle.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the structure of random circuit in IRB is quite different:\n",
    "\n",
    "![random-clifford-circuit](figures/irb-clifford-circuit.png \"Figure 2: random Clifford circuit of IRB\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In this figure, $C_i, i=1,2,\\cdots,m$ are sequence of $m$ random Clifford gates, analogously to the above. $C$ is the gate of our interest that we wish to characterize, which is \"interleaved\" throughout the SRB sequence. Similarly, we apply the $C_{m+1}$ gate, which is inverse of whole $m$ Clifford gates $CC_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Randomized benchmarking\n",
    "\n",
    "We can clearly see that the protocol is a simple extension of SRB. The exact process is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run SRB on the qubits and estimate an average gate fidelity (AGF) $f$ of Clifford gates $C_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run IRB on the qubits and estimate an average gate fidelity $f_c$ of Clifford gates $CC_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use two fidelity parameters $f$ and $f_c$ to calculate the average error rate $r$ of gate $C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The average error rate $r$ must lie in the range $\\left[r^{est}-E,r^{est}+E\\right]$[1], where $r^{est}$ and $E$ are shown as follows, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r^{est} = \\frac{d-1}{d}\\left(1-\\frac{f_c}{f}\\right),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "E = min\\left\\{\\frac{(d-1)\\left[\\vert f-f_c/f\\vert + (1-f)\\right]}{d},\\frac{2(d^2-1)(1-f)}{fd^2} + \\frac{4\\sqrt{1-f}\\sqrt{d^2-1}}{f}\\right\\}.\n",

    "## Practice\n",
    "### Single qubit circuit\n",

    "![single-qubit](figures/irb-single-clifford-circuit.png \"Figure 3: single qubit circuit\")\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we set the target quantum gate to the `H` gate. Please refer to the `Clifford` class or [2] for how Clifford gates are randomly generated. Furthermore, we construct and measure $20$ random circuits in each depth and average the results. Run the example and see the final result."
